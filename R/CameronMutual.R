#' Cameron Mutual Insurance Company data 
#'
#' An illustrative dataset---a matrix (of the dimensions 10\code{x}10) with ten 
#' completed years of claims payment developments of the Cameron Mutual Insurance 
#' company from the period 1988 -- 1997.  The data matrix contains ten 
#' origin/occurrence years (in rows where the first row represents the incident 
#' year 1988) with ten consecutive development periods/years (in columns).
#' 
#' The run-off triangle (the upper-left triangular part of the data matrix) 
#' contains only positive increments making the triangle suitable for the standard 
#' modelling approach---the over-dispersed Poisson model (GLM regression model). 
#' 
#' In practice, the upper-left triangle (the run-off triangle) is typically 
#' observed (known) while the bottom-right triangular part of the data matrix is 
#' treated as a future payments outcome (an "unknown" truth) that should be 
#' estimated/predicted. The Cameron Mutual Insurance data matrix is fully observed 
#' to allow for some goodness-of-fit evaluations.
