\description{
An illustrative dataset---a matrix (of the dimensions 10\code{x}10) with ten
completed years of claims payment developments of the Midwest Family Mutual
Insurance company from the period 1988 -- 1997.  The data matrix contains ten
origin/occurrence years (with the first row representing the incident year
1988) and ten consecutive development periods/years (in columns).
}
\details{
The run-off triangle (the upper-left triangular part of the data matrix)
contains only positive increments making the triangle suitable for the
standard modelling approach---the over-dispersed Poisson model (GLM approach).

In practice, the run-off triangle only (the upper triangular part) of the data
matrix is known while the bottom-right triangular part is treated as a future
outcome (an "unknown" truth) that should be estimated/predicted.
The Midwest Family Mutual Insurance data matrix is fully observed to allow for
some retrospective goodness-of-fit evaluations.
